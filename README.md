## Step-Up Module
![Step-Up Module Diagram](images/step_up_diagram.PNG)

**Overview:** The Step-Up Module is a *DC-to-DC converter that steps up 12V from the Virtual Reality (VR) backpack to 19.5V required by the VR Headset*. 
Because there isn't a proprietary cable that connects the HP Reverb G2 VR backpack to the HP Reverb G2 Headset, I made my own!

**Why?** Our Experiment requires a mobile agent moving in a large environment, which required us to extricate ourselves from a tethered power connection. This is because the Virtual Reality gear - the Headset and Backpack - requires a connection to an outlet..

**How it Works:** As mentioned previously, this DC-to-DC converter takes 12V from the VR backpack steps it up to 19.5V, and goes into the headset. This allows the backpack and headset to be completely untethered to a wall outlet.   



### Step-Up Module Bill of Materials
Here is the Bill of Materials as well as pictures depicting how the step-up module is assembled. Not depicted are the spacers and screws necessary, as well as the DC-DC step-up converter itself. 

Lastly is the fully assembled Step-Up Module
